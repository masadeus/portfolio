This is Albert Mas UI/UX Design professional's portfolio.

This project was developed with HTML5, Sass, jQuery, TweenLite, and ScrollMagic.

Performance basics are covered: assets are minified into single CSS and JS files, and the images are optimized.

I would like to thank Bucky and Web Donut for saving me a bunch of time ;)
